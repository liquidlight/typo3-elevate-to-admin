# Elevate to Admin

Allow users to elevate themselves to admin if they have permission to do so.

Conforms TYPO3 to Cyber Essentials/ISO 27001 standards where users are not supposed to be logging in with an Admin account.

## TODO:

- Allow disabling in dev mode (or any mode)
- Allow potential admins to login when TYPO3 is locked for editors
- PHP 7.4 compatibility
- TYPO3 12 & 13 compatibility
